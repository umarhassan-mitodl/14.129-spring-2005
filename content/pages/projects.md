Each student is required to make a 25-minute presentation on a paper chosen by the student or suggested by the professor (own relevant papers are allowed). In case two or more related papers are presented by several students, one report from the group will suffice.

### Guidelines

Style: 25-minute conference presentation.

Your presentation must include:

*   motivation
*   contribution
*   main points
*   critical analysis

Also required is a written short report briefly outlining contribution of the paper and of related papers.
